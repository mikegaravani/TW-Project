# Issues / bugs / things to address

## General shit to check or fix

- When should a JWT expire? Should it overwrite an earlier token if a new login is made with the same account? Should it expire after a while? Should it expire if the browser is closed??? + Handle logout (aka voluntary token expiration)!!

- NEED LOGOUT FUNCTIONALITY!!!

- There's parts of functions that I will have to write in every component: TODO write them once and import them in the single components

- Fix vite.config.js so I dont have to update it everytime I add a new route

- Frontend: spinner's own class?

- BIG ISSUE: some frontend urls point to backend json!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Frontend: components/note-components/note-style.css has ugly ahh non-working external links!!

- Update API routes: privacy issues?? (For example... Can a user update a note thats not his if they have its _id??, etc...)

## Next in line TODO

- NOTES: MAKE ALL THE FRONTEND WORK!!!!
